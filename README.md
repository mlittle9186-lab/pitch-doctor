`pitch-doctor` is a CLI for web freelancers. Point it at a local business's
website and it produces a client-ready, plain-English audit report -- as a
polished PDF or standalone HTML file -- that you can send straight to the
business owner. No dev jargon. No Lighthouse-dump anxiety. Just "here's what's
costing you customers, and here's what fixing it gets you."

Scan it, brand it with your own name and contact info, send it, close the
deal. Reports render in English, Spanish, French, or Chinese.

## Demo

<!-- TODO: record a short terminal + report walkthrough GIF and drop it here -->
`![pitch-doctor demo](docs/demo.gif)`

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
playwright install chromium  # skip this if you already have Google Chrome installed
```

(Published to PyPI as `pitch-doctor` once the first tag ships -- until then,
install from a checkout as above.)

By default pitch-doctor drives your system-installed Google Chrome
(Playwright's `channel="chrome"`) instead of downloading its own ~150 MB
Chromium bundle. If Chrome isn't installed, run `playwright install chromium`
and change `channel="chrome"` to plain `pw.chromium.launch()` in
`checks/runner.py` and `report/builder.py`.

## Usage

Scan a single site:

```bash
pitch-doctor scan https://example.com --lang en --out reports/
```

Scan a list of sites (one URL per line in `urls.txt`), continuing past any
failures, with a summary table at the end:

```bash
pitch-doctor batch urls.txt --lang es --out reports/
```

Brand the report as your own agency's deliverable:

```bash
pitch-doctor scan https://example.com \
  --brand-name "Acme Web Studio" \
  --brand-email hello@acmewebstudio.com \
  --brand-phone "+1 555 010 2020" \
  --brand-logo ./logo.png \
  --pdf
```

### Web UI (optional)

Prefer a search bar over a terminal? `pitch-doctor serve` launches a small
local web app -- paste a URL, watch the scan progress live (DNS → fetch →
mobile/desktop capture → links → scoring), and get redirected straight to
the finished report:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
pitch-doctor serve   # http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

It calls the exact same scan engine as the CLI and writes reports to the
same `--out` directory -- there's no separate code path to keep in sync.

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--lang` | `en` | Report/CLI language: `en`, `es`, `fr`, or `zh` |
| `--out` | `reports/` | Output directory |
| `--brand-name` | `Your Agency` | Name shown on the report cover and CTA |
| `--brand-email` | _(none)_ | Contact email on the final CTA page |
| `--brand-phone` | _(none)_ | Contact phone on the final CTA page |
| `--brand-logo` | _(none)_ | Path to a logo image for the cover |
| `--json` | off | Also dump raw findings as JSON next to the report |
| `--timeout` | `20` | Per-site timeout, in seconds |
| `--pdf` | off | Also render a PDF (via headless Chromium) alongside the HTML report |

### Sample report

<!-- TODO: replace with an actual screenshot of examples/example.com.html once you have one you like -->
`![sample report cover](docs/sample-report-cover.png)`

A generated example lives in [`examples/`](examples/) after you run the scan
described below.

## The checks

Each check returns a severity (`critical` / `warning` / `ok`), the evidence
that led to it, and a business-language explanation of why it matters. They
run in the order below, which is also roughly their order of importance to
the business.

**Reach and trust**

1. **Reachability / uptime** -- DNS resolution, response status, redirect chain length, www/non-www consistency.
2. **SSL / HTTPS** -- missing HTTPS or an invalid certificate.
3. **Security headers** -- `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, CSP, HSTS.
4. **Load speed** -- time until visible content appears (First Contentful Paint), measured via Playwright on a simulated mid-range mobile connection. We deliberately measure *perceived* load time, not the browser's full `load` event -- the latter blocks on every slow third-party script/ad/tracker and can report numbers far worse than what a real visitor actually experiences.
5. **Mobile rendering** -- viewport meta tag, horizontal overflow, and side-by-side phone + desktop screenshots.
6. **Mobile UX (advanced)** -- responsive images (`srcset`), mobile navigation, tappable `tel:` numbers, viewport handling on notched devices.

**Findability and usability**

7. **Outdated signals** -- stale copyright year in the footer.
8. **Broken links** -- up to 25 internal links checked concurrently for 404s.
9. **Contact friction** -- phone numbers not wrapped in `tel:` links, missing email/contact link, missing address.
10. **Search visibility basics** -- title, meta description, Open Graph tags, favicon, `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD.
11. **SEO (advanced)** -- Open Graph completeness, Schema.org JSON-LD, canonical tags, `robots` meta.
12. **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)** -- image alt text, heading structure, form labels, semantic navigation.
13. **Legal compliance** -- privacy policy, terms of service, cookie notice, a way to make a data request.

**Conversion and measurement**

14. **User experience / CTA clarity** -- clear calls to action, trust signals, pricing transparency, form complexity.
15. **Analytics & tracking** -- Google Analytics, GTM, Facebook Pixel, event tracking, UTM handling.
16. **Performance optimization details** -- gzip/Brotli compression, cache headers, lazy loading, WebP, third-party script count.

> Checks 3, 6, and 11-16 currently emit English-only copy; `--lang` still
> translates the report chrome and the original eight checks. Translating the
> newer ones is open work.

## The health score

Every check starts from a perfect site (100 points) and loses points based on
its severity. The formula is intentionally simple enough to reconstruct by
hand from the report:

```
score = max(0, 100 - sum(deduction(check) for check in checks))
```

| Check | Critical | Warning |
|---|---|---|
| Load speed | -15 | -8 |
| SSL / HTTPS | -15 | -8 |
| Reachability / uptime | -12 | -6 |
| Mobile rendering | -12 | -6 |
| Security headers | -8 | -4 |
| Broken links | -8 | -4 |
| Contact friction | -8 | -4 |
| Search visibility basics | -8 | -4 |
| Accessibility | -7 | -3 |
| SEO (advanced) | -6 | -3 |
| Legal compliance | -6 | -3 |
| Outdated signals | -5 | -3 |
| Mobile UX (advanced) | -5 | -3 |
| User experience / CTA | -5 | -3 |
| Performance optimization | -5 | -3 |
| Analytics & tracking | -4 | -2 |

The weights are front-loaded on purpose: the top four checks alone cost 54
points, so a site that's slow, insecure, unreachable and broken on phones
grades **F** no matter how it does elsewhere. All 16 at critical sum to 129 --
more than 100 -- so the score floors at 0 rather than going negative.

An `ok` result always costs 0. Letter grades: **A** 90-100, **B** 80-89,
**C** 70-79, **D** 60-69, **F** below 60. See `pitch_doctor/scoring.py` for
the implementation.

## Why HTML by default, and PDF on demand

Every report is generated as a single self-contained HTML file first
(screenshots and any logo are embedded as base64 data URIs -- no external
assets, opens offline, emails cleanly as an attachment). PDF is a second step,
and there are two routes to it depending on where you are:

- **CLI (`--pdf`)** -- renders that same HTML with the headless Chromium
  instance Playwright already ships with (`page.pdf()`). No extra system
  dependencies, since Playwright is a hard requirement anyway.
- **Web UI ("Download as PDF" button, or Ctrl/Cmd+S)** -- posts to
  `/reports/{filename}/generate-pdf`, which converts the HTML with
  **WeasyPrint** and serves the result from `/pdf/{filename}`. WeasyPrint is
  an optional dependency of the `[web]` extra; if it isn't importable the
  endpoint returns an error and the button degrades to a no-op rather than
  breaking the page.

WeasyPrint is kept out of the CLI path deliberately: it depends on native
GTK/Pango libraries that are awkward to install on Windows, and the CLI must
work on a bare checkout. On Debian/Ubuntu hosts, the button needs those
libraries present:

```bash
apt-get install -y libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 libcairo2 libffi8
```

## Deploy the web UI (free)

This is a **single Python service** (FastAPI UI + scan engine + Playwright).
There is no separate static frontend — **Vercel is not a good fit** (serverless
timeouts, no long-lived Chromium).

Recommended free host: **[Render](https://render.com)** (Docker web service).

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render: **New → Blueprint** (uses `render.yaml`) or **New → Web Service**
   with Docker runtime.
3. After deploy, attach a custom domain (e.g. `test.mariosalvarez.com`):
   - Render → service → **Settings → Custom Domains**
   - At your DNS: CNAME `test` → the hostname Render gives you
     (e.g. `pitch-doctor.onrender.com`).

Environment variables used in production:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL` | `chromium` | Use Playwright's bundled browser (not system Chrome) |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_NO_SANDBOX` | `1` | Required inside most containers |
| `PORT` | set by host | Listen port |

Local Docker:

```bash
docker build -t pitch-doctor .
docker run --rm -p 8765:8765 pitch-doctor
# open http://localhost:8765
```

**Free-tier caveats:** cold starts after idle, and 512 MB RAM can OOM on heavy
scans — upgrade the plan if Chromium is killed.

[Railway](https://railway.app), [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com).
